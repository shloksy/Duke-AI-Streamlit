    "passage": "On a bright sunny day, Mia and her best friend Jake decided to explore the hidden forest behind their neighborhood. They had heard stories about a magical stream that sparkled like diamonds under the sun. Armed with a map they drew themselves, they set off on their adventure. As they walked, they laughed and shared their dreams of finding treasures and meeting friendly woodland creatures. They spotted colorful butterflies and listened to the birds singing sweet melodies. After a while, they finally found the magical stream. It was even more beautiful than they had imagined! The water shimmered in every color of the rainbow, and they could see little fish dancing beneath the surface. Mia and Jake took off their shoes and dipped their toes in the cool water, squealing with delight. They splashed each other and made wishes on the fish that swam by. As the sun began to set, they knew it was time to head home, but they promised to return to their magical place again. That day, they not only found the stream but also deepened their friendship, realizing that adventures are always better when shared with someone special.",
